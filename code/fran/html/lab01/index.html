    <div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> 
        is considered by many to be the greatest rock guitarist ever. 
        After years of playing on the R&B circuit with a number of famous
        artists, Jimmy Hendrix became Jimi Hendrix and formed the 
        Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1966. One of his most iconic performances
        was as the closing act at Woodstock, where he played a transcendent
        version of the Star Spangled Banner. He was born on November 27, 1962 
        in Seattle. He died on September 18, 1970.
