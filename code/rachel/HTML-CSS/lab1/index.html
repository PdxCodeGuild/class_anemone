            Ian Murray (commonly refered to as Young Ian) is a fictional character from the best selling book series <i>Outlander</i> by Diana Gabaldon. His first apperance is in book 3, <i>Voyager</i>, the day he is born. His uncle, Jamie Fraser, who is wanted for having fought in the Jacobite rebellion against the British, comes to the house just as Ian is being born. As Jamie is holding Young Ian, English soldiers enter the house insearch of a weapon they heard being fired from the estate. Jamie is forced to hide in a closet with Young Ian until the redcoats leave. This is the first of many exciting events in Young Ian's life.<br/>
            <br/>
            At the age of fourteen, Ian runs away from home in Lallybroch to stay with his uncle Jamie in Edinburgh. While in Edinburgh, Ian helps his uncle with his print shop and liquor-smuggling. When an agent of the Crown is found searching Jamie's print shop, Ian starts a fire the print shop to cover up Jamie's illegal dealings and narrowly escapes from the shop before the building is consumed by the fire. When Ian's father finds him, he is forced back to Lallybroch with Jamie and his wife, Claire, who has recently returned to Jamie. With Claire back in Lallybroch, events transpire where Young Ian serves as a middle-man between Claire and Jamie as Claire tries to leave and Jamie is shot by Laoghaire MacKenzie in the shoulder. After Jamie agrees to a settlement with Laoghaire, Young Ian goes with Jamie and Clair to an island off the north coast of Scottland to retrieve the Sikies' Isle treasure in order to pay Laoghair. Since Jamie cannot swim due to his injury, Ian swims across to the island to retrieve the treasure for Jamie. In the process of getting the box, Young Ian is captured by pirates.<br/>

            Ian is taken from Scotland all the way to Hispaniola in the West Indias to a woman named Mistress Abernathy, who is in search of a stone only found in virgins, When she discovers Young Ian is not a virgin, this inevitably saves his life as Mistress Abernathy then drugs Ian and uses him for sex, rather than killing him like the other young boys she took. Eventually she takes Ian to a cave called Abandawe to use as a sacrafice. Ian is saved when Jamie and Claire show up and Claire kills Geillis (Misstress Abernathy).<br/>
