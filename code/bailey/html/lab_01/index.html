            Captain Pete Mitchell better known by his callsign "Maverick" is an F-14 pilot for the United States Navy.  
            He is famously known for being one of the first to engage in air to air combat against the Soviet MiG-28; where he and his wingman "Iceman" were able to collectively shoot down 4 Soviet MiG-28's. 
            Maverick was known to be a notriously daring and reckless pilot which he attributes to his late father Duke Mitchell who was shot down over Vietnam in 1965.
