    <h1>F-35B Lightning II (Marine Corps)</h1>

        <p class="intro">The F-35 is a 5th generation stealth mutlirole aircraft built for the battlefield of the future.
            The F-35 strengthens national security, enhances global partnerships and powers economic growth. 
            It is the most lethal, survivable and connected fighter aircraft in the world, giving pilots an
            advantage against any adversary and enabling them to execute their mission and come home safe.
            The F-35 family includes three variants â€” all single-seat jets. 
            The F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant, the F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing variant, 
            and the F-35C carrier variant.  All three variants have similar performance characteristics and the 
            exact same advanced avionics. The variation between models allows military forces to achieve service-specific 
            mission capability, while still taking advantage of the economies of scale that result from the parts 
            and processes that are common to all three variants.</p>

        <h2 class="variant">F-35B</h2> 
        <p class="variant-p">Can land vertically like a helicopter and take-off in very short distances. This allows it to operate from 
                austere, short-field bases and a range of air-capable ships. The F-35B is operated by the United States Marine Corps, 
                the United Kingdom, and the Italian Air Force.</p>
