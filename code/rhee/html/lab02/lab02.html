                The engine is the heart of your car. It is a complex machine built to convert heat from burning gas into the force that turns the road wheels. That is why the machine is called an internal combustion engine . As the mixture burns it expands, providing power to drive the car.

                The drivetrain includes the transmission, the driveshaft, the axles, and the wheels. Simply put, it works in conjunction with the engine to move the wheels. The drivetrain system is an essential component of a vehicle and the transmission is an integral part of the drivetrain.
