        <p id="para1"> Archer is an adult animated sitcom with a James Bond style action based on a <br>secret agent named Sterling Malory Archer. Archer, a fictional character is an extremely narcissistic, <br>arrogant, selfish, insensitive, self-absorbed, and sex-crazed man who is constantly focused on <br>himself and his own needs and desires. He arrogantly believes himself to understand any <br>situation better than his colleagues. Thus, Archer selfishly refuses to admit when he is proven wrong <br>and will go to extreme lengths to cover up his mistakes, particularly when they may incur his mother's <br>scorn. While working as a secret agent
            for the International Secret Intelligence Service,<br> also known as ISIS, he aims to be the center of attention while trying to defreat his long time <br>rival Barry Dylan, a former KGB sypmaster.
