         <div class ="quote">
            <p id="quote">"We do not propose to say that there shall be no rich men. We do not ask to divide the wealth. We only propose that, when one man gets more than he 
        and his children and children's children can spend or use in their lifetimes, that then we shall say that such person has his share. That means that
         a few million dollars is the limit to what any one man can own."</p>
