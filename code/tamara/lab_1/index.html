                <h2>Overview</h2>
            </span>
            <p>Andrew Skurka is an American professional backpacker who is best known for his two long-distance hiking 
                firstsâ€”the 6,875-mile Great Western Loop and the 7,778-mile Sea-to-Sea Route. He was named the 2007 
                "Adventurer of the Year" by National Geographic Adventure (which described him as "a Gen Y version of 
                Henry David Thoreau or John Muir") and the 2005 "Person of the Year" by Backpacker magazine.</p>

                <h2>Hiking Accomplishments</h2>
             </span>
            <p>In November 2007, Skurka completed the Great Western Loop, a 6,875-mile journey that links together 5 
                long-distance hiking trails, 12 National Parks, and over 75 wilderness areas, which he hiked in 208 days, 
                an average of 33 miles per day. In addition, in July 2005 Skurka completed the Sea-to-Sea Route, 
                a transcontinental network of long-distance hiking trails from Quebec to Washington, which took him 11 months 
                and which involved 1,400 miles of snowshoeing. Skurka's shorter hikes include the 1,700-mile California 
                section of the Pacific Crest Trail (in 45 days), the 486-mile Colorado Trail (twice), the 2,170-mile Appalachian 
                Trail (in 95 days), a 385-mile trek through northern Minnesota in January, and many week- and weekend-long trips 
                in Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming. In 2010 he hiked a 4,679-mile route around Alaska, which took him 176 days.

            <p><q>After finding the migration trail of the Porcupine caribou, I began to cry uncontrollably, realizing that 
                in this vast and untamed wilderness, I was like them: While being tortured by hellacious mosquitoes, soaked 
                by torrential rains, and stalked by grizzlies and wolves, we were all trying to stay moving, and we slept 
                and ate only to continue our forward progress.</q> - Andrew Skurka </p>
