    <p class="intro">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_(The_Office)">Michael Scott</a> is a regional branch manager for a paper company known as Dunder Mifflin Inc in Scranton, Pennsylvania. 
        His employees and fellow workmates may consider him a fool and an incapable manager, but his prsonality and passion for his work somehow keeps his branch afloat.
        Outside of being a branch manager Michael is also a telemarketer for a small scranton company. 
        For fun, he takes improv classes as he beleives it improves his acting whenever he becomes one of his many alter egos.
        He eventually leaves Dunder Mifflin to live in Colorado with his fianc√©e, Holly, who he met during his time with the company.
