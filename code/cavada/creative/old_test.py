 'text': 'In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.\n'
         'The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the '
         'deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.\n'
         'God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.\n'
         'God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light '
         'from the darkness.\n'
         'God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”. '
         'There was evening and there was morning, the first day.\n'
         'God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and '
         'let it divide the waters from the waters.”\n'
         'God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the '
         'expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was '
         'so.\n'
         'God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was '
         'morning, a second day.\n'
         'God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one '
         'place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so.\n'
         'God called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the '
         'waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good.\n'
         'God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and '
         'fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, '
         'on the earth”; and it was so.\n'
         'The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and '
         'trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and '
         'God saw that it was good.\n'
         'There was evening and there was morning, a third day.\n'
         'God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide '
         'the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, '
         'days, and years;\n'
         'and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light '
         'on the earth”; and it was so.\n'
         'God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, '
         'and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.\n'
         'God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth,\n'
         'and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light '
         'from the darkness. God saw that it was good.\n'
         'There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\n'
         'God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let '
         'birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.”\n'
         'God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that '
         'moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every '
         'winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.\n'
         'God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the '
         'waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”\n'
         'There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\n'
         'God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, '
         'livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their '
         'kind”; and it was so.\n'
         'God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the '
         'livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground '
         'after its kind. God saw that it was good.\n'
         'God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let '
         'them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of '
         'the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over '
         'every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”\n'
         'God created man in his own image. In God’s image he created him; '
         'male and female he created them.\n'
         'God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the '
         'earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over '
         'the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the '
         'earth.”\n'
         'God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which '
         'is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears '
         'fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.\n'
         'To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to '
         'everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have '
         'given every green herb for food;” and it was so.\n'
         'God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. '
         'There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.\n'
         'Joseph fell on his father’s face, wept on him, and kissed him.\n'
         'Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; '
         'and the physicians embalmed Israel.\n'
         'Forty days were fulfilled for him, for that is how many the days it '
         'takes to embalm. The Egyptians wept for him for seventy days.\n'
         'When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the '
         'house of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, '
         'please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,\n'
         '‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my '
         'grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now '
         'therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come '
         'again.’”\n'
         'Pharaoh said, “Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you '
         'swear.”\n'
         'Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the '
         'servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the '
         'land of Egypt,\n'
         'All the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house. Only '
         'their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the '
         'land of Goshen.\n'
         'There went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very '
         'great company.\n'
         'They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the '
         'Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and severe '
         'lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days.\n'
         'When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning '
         'in the floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the '
         'Egyptians.” Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is '
         'beyond the Jordan.\n'
         'His sons did to him just as he commanded them,\n'
         'for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in '
         'the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the '
         'field, as a possession for a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, '
         'near Mamre.\n'
         'Joseph returned into Egypt—he, and his brothers, and all that went '
         'up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.\n'
         'When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, '
         '“It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for '
         'all the evil which we did to him.”\n'
         'They sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded before '
         'he died, saying,\n'
         '‘You shall tell Joseph, “Now please forgive the disobedience of your '
         'brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.”’ Now, please '
         'forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father.” '
         'Joseph wept when they spoke to him.\n'
         'His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, '
         '“Behold, we are your servants.”\n'
         'Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for am I in the place of '
         'God?\n'
         'As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to '
         'bring to pass, as it is today, to save many people alive.\n'
         'Now therefore don’t be afraid. I will nourish you and your little '
         'ones.” He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.\n'
         'Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father’s house. Joseph lived one '
         'hundred ten years.\n'
         'Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. The children '
         'also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph’s knees.\n'
         'Joseph said to his brothers, “I am dying, but God will surely visit '
         'you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to '
         'Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”\n'
         'Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, “God will '
         'surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.”\n'
         'So Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed '
         'him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n',

         'even all those who were counted were six hundred three thousand five '

         'But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not counted '
         'among them.\n'
         'For Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\n'
         '“Only the tribe of Levi you shall not count, neither shall you take '
         'a census of them among the children of Israel;\n'
         'but appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and '
         'over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They '
         'shall carry the tabernacle, and all its furnishings; and they shall '
         'take care of it, and shall encamp around it.\n'
         'When the tabernacle is to move, the Levites shall take it down; and '
         'when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set it up. '
         'The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.\n'
         'The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own '
         'camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their '
         'divisions.\n'
         'But the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the Testimony, '
         'that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of '
         'Israel: and the Levites shall be responsible for the Tabernacle of '
         'the Testimony.”\n'
         'Thus the children of Israel did. According to all that Yahweh '
         'commanded Moses, so they did.\n'
         'The heads of the fathers’ households of the family of the children '
         'of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families '
         'of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before '
         'the princes, the heads of the fathers’ households of the children of '
         'Israel.\n'
         'They said, “Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for '
         'inheritance by lot to the children of Israel. My lord was commanded '
         'by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his '
         'daughters.\n'
         'If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the '
         'children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from '
         'the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance '
         'of the tribe to which they shall belong. So will it be taken away '
         'from the lot of our inheritance.\n'
         'When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their '
         'inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they '
         'shall belong. So their inheritance will be taken away from the '
         'inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”\n'
         'Moses commanded the children of Israel according to Yahweh’s word, '
         'saying, “The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right.\n'
         'This is the thing which Yahweh does command concerning the daughters '
         'of Zelophehad, saying, ‘Let them be married to whom they think best; '
         'only they shall marry into the family of the tribe of their father.\n'
         'So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel move from tribe to '
         'tribe; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of '
         'the tribe of his fathers.\n'
         'Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the '
         'children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe '
         'of her father, that the children of Israel may each possess the '
         'inheritance of his fathers.\n'
         'So shall no inheritance move from one tribe to another tribe; for '
         'the tribes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own '
         'inheritance.’”\n'
         'The daughters of Zelophehad did as Yahweh commanded Moses:\n'
         'for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of '
         'Zelophehad, were married to their father’s brothers’ sons.\n'
         'They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son '
         'of Joseph. Their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of '
         'their father.\n'
         'These are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh commanded '
         'by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the '
         'Jordan at Jericho.\n',

         'You came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let us send men '
         'before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word '
         'again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we '
         'shall come.”\n'
         'The thing pleased me well. I took twelve men of you, one man for '
         'every tribe.\n'
         'They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the '
         'valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.\n'
         'They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought '
         'it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good '
         'land which Yahweh our God gives to us.”\n'
         'Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of '
         'Yahweh your God.\n'
         'You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because Yahweh hated us, he '
         'has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand '
         'of the Amorites, to destroy us.\n'
         'Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, '
         'saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are '
         'great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of '
         'the Anakim there!’”\n'
         'Then I said to you, “Don’t dread, neither be afraid of them.\n'
         'Yahweh your God who goes before you, he will fight for you, '
         'according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,\n'
         'and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your God '
         'bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, '
         'until you came to this place.”\n'
         'Yet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh your God,\n'
         'who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch '
         'your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should '
         'go, and in the cloud by day.\n'
         'Yahweh heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, '
         'saying,\n'
         '“Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the '
         'good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,\n'
         'except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the '
         'land that he has trodden on to him, and to his children, because he '
         'has wholly followed Yahweh.”\n'
         'Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also '
         'shall not go in there.\n'
         'Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. '
         'Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.\n'
         'Moreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or '
         'killed, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or '
         'evil, shall go in there. I will give it to them, and they shall '
         'possess it.\n'
         'But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by '
         'the way to the Red Sea.”\n'
         'Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against Yahweh, we '
         'will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded '
         'us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go '
         'up into the hill country.\n'
         'Yahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I '
         'am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.’”\n'
         'So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against '
         'the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into '
         'the hill country.\n'
         'The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you, '
         'and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to '
         'Hormah.\n'
         'You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn’t listen to '
         'your voice, nor turn his ear to you.\n'
         'So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you '
         'remained.\n'
         'Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of '
         'Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. Yahweh showed him all the land '
         'of Gilead, to Dan,\n'
         'and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the '
         'land of Judah, to the western sea,\n'
         'and the south, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of '
         'palm trees, to Zoar.\n'
         'Yahweh said to him, “This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to '
         'Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ I '
         'have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over '
         'there.”\n'
         'So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, '
         'according to Yahweh’s word.\n'
         'He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor, '
         'but no man knows where his tomb is to this day.\n'
         'Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died. His eye was not '
         'dim, nor his strength gone.\n'
         'The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty '
         'days, until the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were '
         'ended.\n'
         'Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses '
         'had laid his hands on him. The children of Israel listened to him, '
         'and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.\n'
         'Since then, there has not arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, '
         'whom Yahweh knew face to face,\n'
         'in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do in the '
         'land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his '
         'land,\n'
         'and in all the mighty hand, and in all the awesome deeds, which '
         'Moses did in the sight of all Israel.\n',
