                  "John answered them, 'I baptize in water, but among you "

                  "He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before "

                  "These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where "
                  "John was baptizing.\n"
                  "The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, "

                  "world!\n"
                  "This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is "
                  "preferred before me, for he was before me.'\n"
                  "I didn't know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in "
                  "water: that he would be revealed to Israel.'\n"
                  "John testified, saying, 'I have seen the Spirit descending "
                  "like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.\n"
                  "I didn't recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in "
                  "water, he said to me, 'On whomever you will see the Spirit "
                  "descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who "
                  "baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'\n"
                  "I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of "

                  "Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his "
                  "disciples,\n"
                  "and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, 'Behold, the "

                  "The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed "
                  "Jesus.\n"
                  "Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them,\n"
                  "'What are you looking for?'\n"
                  "They said to him, 'Rabbi' (which is to say, being "
                  "interpreted, Teacher), 'where are you staying?'\n"
                  "He said to them,\n"
                  "'Come, and see.'\n"
                  "They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed "
                  "with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.\n"
                  "One of the two who heard John, and followed him, was "
                  "Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.\n"
                  "He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, 'We "

                  "Christ).\n"
                  "He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said,\n"

                  "Cephas' (which is by interpretation, Peter).\n"
                  "On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, "
                  "and he found Philip. Jesus said to him,\n"
                  "'Follow me.'\n"
                  "Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and "
                  "Peter.\n"
                  "Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, 'We have found "
                  "him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: "
                  "Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.'\n"
                  "Nathanael said to him, 'Can any good thing come out of "
                  "Nazareth?'\n"
                  "Philip said to him, 'Come and see.'\n"
                  "Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him,\n"
                  "'Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!'\n"
                  "Nathanael said to him, 'How do you know me?'\n"
                  "Jesus answered him,\n"
                  "'Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig "
                  "tree, I saw you.'\n"
                  "Nathanael answered him, 'Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You "
                  "are King of Israel!'\n"
                  "Jesus answered him,\n"
                  "'Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' "
                  "do you believe? You will see greater things than these!'\n"
                  "He said to him,\n"
                  "'Most certainly, I tell you all, hereafter you will see "
                  "heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and "
                  "descending on the Son of Man.'\n"
                  "After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the "
                  "disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this "
                  "way.\n"
                  "Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in "
                  "Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his "
                  "disciples were together.\n"
                  "Simon Peter said to them, 'I'm going fishing.'\n"
                  "They told him, 'We are also coming with you.' They "
                  "immediately went out, and entered into the boat. That "
                  "night, they caught nothing.\n"
                  "But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach, "
                  "yet the disciples didn't know that it was Jesus.\n"
                  "Jesus therefore said to them,\n"
                  "'Children, have you anything to eat?'\n"
                  "\n"
                  "They answered him, 'No.'\n"
                  "He said to them,\n"
                  "'Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will "
                  "find some.'\n"
                  "They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw "
                  "it in for the multitude of fish.\n"
                  "That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "
                  "'It's the Lord!'\n"
                  "So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped "
                  "his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself "
                  "into the sea.\n"
                  "But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they "
                  "were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits "
                  "away), dragging the net full of fish.\n"
                  "So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals "
                  "there, and fish laid on it, and bread.\n"
                  "Jesus said to them,\n"
                  "'Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.'\n"
                  "Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of "
                  "great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there "
                  "were so many, the net wasn't torn.\n"
                  "Jesus said to them,\n"
                  "'Come and eat breakfast.'\n"
                  "None of the disciples dared inquire of him, 'Who are you?' "
                  "knowing that it was the Lord.\n"
                  "Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and "
                  "the fish likewise.\n"
                  "This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his "
                  "disciples, after he had risen from the dead.\n"
                  "So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon "
                  "Peter,\n"
                  "'Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?'\n"
                  "He said to him, 'Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection "
                  "for you.'\n"
                  "He said to him,\n"
                  "'Feed my lambs.'\n"
                  "He said to him again a second time,\n"
                  "'Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?'\n"
                  "He said to him, 'Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection "
                  "for you.'\n"
                  "He said to him,\n"
                  "'Tend my sheep.'\n"
                  "He said to him the third time,\n"
                  "'Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?'\n"
                  "Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time,\n"
                  "'Do you have affection for me?' He said to him, 'Lord, you "
                  "know everything. You know that I have affection for you.'\n"
                  "Jesus said to him,\n"

                  "Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed "
                  "yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But when you are "
                  "old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will "
                  "dress you, and carry you where you don't want to go.'\n"
                  "Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would "
                  "glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him,\n"
                  "'Follow me.'\n"
                  "Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This "
                  "was the disciple whom Jesus loved, the one who had also "
                  "leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper and asked, 'Lord, who "
                  "is going to betray You?'\n"
                  "Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, 'Lord, what about this "

                  "This saying therefore went out among the brothers, that "
                  "this disciple wouldn't die. Yet Jesus didn't say to him "
