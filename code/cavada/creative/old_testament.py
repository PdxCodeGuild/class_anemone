                     "He said to Jehoshaphat, 'Will you go with me to battle "

                     "The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, "

                     "Micaiah said, 'Therefore hear Yahweh's word. I saw "

                     "Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two "

                     "When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they "

                     "When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not "

                     "A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the "
                     "king of Israel between the joints of the armor. "
                     "Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, 'Turn "

                     "severely wounded.'\n"
                     "The battle increased that day. The king was propped up "
                     "in his chariot facing the Syrians, and died at evening. "
                     "The blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the "

                     "A cry went throughout the army about the going down of "

                     "So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they "

                     "They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the "

                  "He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, 'Sit "
                  "down here,' and they sat down.\n"
                  "He said to the near kinsman, 'Naomi, who has come back out "
                  "of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, "
                  "which was our brother Elimelech's.\n"
                  "I thought I should tell you, saying, 'Buy it before those "
                  "who sit here, and before the elders of my people.' If you "
                  "will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, "
                  "then tell me, that I may know. For there is no one to "
                  "redeem it besides you; and I am after you.'\n"
                  "He said, 'I will redeem it.'\n"
                  "Then Boaz said, 'On the day you buy the field from the hand "
                  "of Naomi, you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess, the "
                  "wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his "
                  "inheritance.'\n"
                  "The near kinsman said, 'I can't redeem it for myself, lest "
                  "I endanger my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption "
                  "for yourself; for I can't redeem it.'\n"
                  "Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning "
                  "redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: "
                  "a man took off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and "
                  "this was the way of formalizing transactions in Israel.\n"
                  "So the near kinsman said to Boaz, 'Buy it for yourself,' "
                  "then he took off his shoe.\n"
                  "Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, 'You are "
                  "witnesses today, that I have bought all that was "
                  "Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, from "
                  "the hand of Naomi.\n"
                  "Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have "
                  "purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead "
                  "on his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be "
                  "cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his "
                  "place. You are witnesses today.'\n"
                  "All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, "
                  "'We are witnesses. May Yahweh make the woman who has come "
                  "into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which both built "
                  "the house of Israel; and treat you worthily in Ephrathah, "
                  "and be famous in Bethlehem.\n"
                  "Let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore "
                  "to Judah, of the offspring which Yahweh will give you by "
                  "this young woman.'\n"
                  "So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in "
                  "to her, and Yahweh enabled her to conceive, and she bore a "
                  "son.\n"
                  "The women said to Naomi, 'Blessed be Yahweh, who has not "
                  "left you today without a near kinsman. Let his name be "
                  "famous in Israel.\n"
                  "He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you in "

                  "is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.'\n"
                  "Naomi took the child, and laid him in her bosom, and became "
                  "nurse to it.\n"
                  "The women, her neighbors, gave him a name, saying, 'A son "
