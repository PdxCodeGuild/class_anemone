                <p>Paul, called to be an apostle of 
                    Jesus Christ through the will of 
                    God, and our brother Sosthenes,
                    to the assembly of God which is 
                    at Corinth; those who are 
                    sanctified in Christ Jesus, 
                    called to be saints, with all 
                    who call on the name of our Lord 
                    Jesus Christ in every place, 
                    both theirs and ours:
                    Grace to you and peace from God 
                    our Father and the Lord Jesus 
                    Christ.
                    I always thank my God concerning 
                    you, for the grace of God which 
                    was given you in Christ Jesus;
                    that in everything you were 
                    enriched in him, in all speech 
                    and all knowledge;
                    even as the testimony of Christ 
                    was confirmed in you:
                    so that you come behind in no 
                    gift; waiting for the revelation 
                    of our Lord Jesus Christ;
                    who will also confirm you until 
                    the end, blameless in the day of 
                    our Lord Jesus Christ.
                    God is faithful, through whom 
                    you were called into the 
                    fellowship of his Son, Jesus 
                    Christ, our Lord.
                    Now I beg you, brothers, through 
                    the name of our Lord, Jesus 
                    Christ, that you all speak the 
                    same thing, and that there be no 
                    divisions among you, but that 
                    you be perfected together in the 
                    same mind and in the same 
                    judgment.
                    For it has been reported to me 
                    concerning you, my brothers, by 
                    "those who are from Chloes "
                    household, that there are 
                    contentions among you.
                    Now I mean this, that each one 
                    "of you says, I follow Paul, I "
                    "follow Apollos, I follow "
                    "Cephas, and, I follow "
                    "Christ."
                    Is Christ divided? Was Paul 
                    crucified for you? Or were you 
                    baptized into the name of Paul?
                    I thank God that I baptized none 
                    of you, except Crispus and 
                    Gaius,
                    so that no one should say that I 
                    had baptized you into my own 
                    name.
                    (I also baptized the household 
                    of Stephanas; besides them, I 
                    "dont know whether I baptized "
                    any other.)
                    For Christ sent me not to 
                    baptize, but to preach the Good 
                    "Newsnot in wisdom of words, so "
                    that the cross of Christ 
                    "wouldnt be made void."
                    For the word of the cross is 
                    foolishness to those who are 
                    dying, but to us who are saved 
                    it is the power of God.
                    For it is written,
                    "I will destroy the wisdom of "
                    the wise,
                    I will bring the discernment of 
                    "the discerning to nothing."
                    Where is the wise? Where is the 
                    scribe? Where is the lawyer of 
                    "this world? Hasnt God made "
                    foolish the wisdom of this 
                    world?
                    For seeing that in the wisdom of 
                    God, the world through its 
                    "wisdom didnt know God, it was "
                    "Gods good pleasure through the "
                    foolishness of the preaching to 
                    save those who believe.
                    For Jews ask for signs, Greeks 
                    seek after wisdom,
                    but we preach Christ crucified; 
                    a stumbling block to Jews, and 
                    foolishness to Greeks,
                    but to those who are called, 
                    both Jews and Greeks, Christ is 
                    the power of God and the wisdom 
                    of God.
                    Because the foolishness of God 
                    is wiser than men, and the 
                    weakness of God is stronger than 
                    men.
                    For you see your calling, 
                    brothers, that not many are wise 
                    according to the flesh, not many 
                    mighty, and not many noble;
                    but God chose the foolish things 
                    of the world that he might put 
                    to shame those who are wise. God 
                    chose the weak things of the 
                    world, that he might put to 
                    shame the things that are 
                    strong;</p>

                <p>That which was from the beginning, that 
                    which we have heard, that which we have 
                    seen with our eyes, that which we saw, 
                    and our hands touched, concerning the 
                    Word of life
                    (and the life was revealed, and we have 
                    seen, and testify, and declare to you 
                    the life, the eternal life, which was 
                    with the Father, and was revealed to 
                    us);
                    that which we have seen and heard we 
                    declare to you, that you also may have 
                    fellowship with us. Yes, and our 
                    fellowship is with the Father, and with 
                    his Son, Jesus Christ.
                    And we write these things to you, that 
                    our joy may be fulfilled.
                    This is the message which we have heard 
                    from him and announce to you, that God 
                    is light, and in him is no darkness at 
                    all.
                    If we say that we have fellowship with 
                    him and walk in the darkness, we lie, 
                    "and dont tell the truth."
                    But if we walk in the light, as he is 
                    in the light, we have fellowship with 
                    one another, and the blood of Jesus 
                    Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all 
                    sin.
                    If we say that we have no sin, we 
                    deceive ourselves, and the truth is not 
                    in us.
                    If we confess our sins, he is faithful 
                    and righteous to forgive us the sins, 
                    and to cleanse us from all 
                    unrighteousness.
                    "If we say that we havent sinned, we "
                    make him a liar, and his word is not in 
                    us.
                    Whoever believes that Jesus is the 
                    Christ has been born of God. Whoever 
                    loves the Father also loves the child 
                    who is born of him.
                    By this we know that we love the 
                    children of God, when we love God and 
                    keep his commandments.
                    For this is loving God, that we keep 
                    his commandments. His commandments are 
                    not grievous.
                    For whatever is born of God overcomes 
                    the world. This is the victory that has 
                    overcome the world: your faith.
                    Who is he who overcomes the world, but 
                    he who believes that Jesus is the Son 
                    of God?
                    This is he who came by water and blood, 
                    Jesus Christ; not with the water only, 
                    but with the water and the blood. It is 
                    the Spirit who testifies, because the 
                    Spirit is the truth.
                    For there are three who testify:
                    the Spirit, the water, and the blood; 
                    and the three agree as one.
                    If we receive the witness of men, the 
                    witness of God is greater; for this is 
                    "Gods testimony which he has testified "
                    concerning his Son.
                    He who believes in the Son of God has 
                    the testimony in himself. He who 
                    "doesnt believe God has made him a "
                    liar, because he has not believed in 
                    the testimony that God has given 
                    concerning his Son.
                    The testimony is this, that God gave to 
                    us eternal life, and this life is in 
                    his Son.
                    He who has the Son has the life. He who 
                    "doesnt have Gods Son doesnt have the "
                    life.
                    These things I have written to you who 
                    believe in the name of the Son of God, 
                    that you may know that you have eternal 
                    life, and that you may continue to 
                    believe in the name of the Son of God.
                    This is the boldness which we have 
                    toward him, that, if we ask anything 
                    according to his will, he listens to 
                    us.
                    And if we know that he listens to us, 
                    whatever we ask, we know that we have 
                    the petitions which we have asked of 
                    him.
                    If anyone sees his brother sinning a 
                    sin not leading to death, he shall ask, 
                    and God will give him life for those 
                    who sin not leading to death. There is 
                    "a sin leading to death. I dont say "
                    that he should make a request 
                    concerning this.
                    All unrighteousness is sin, and there 
                    is a sin not leading to death.
                    We know that whoever is born of God 
                    "doesnt sin, but he who was born of God "
                    "keeps himself, and the evil one doesnt "
                    touch him.
                    We know that we are of God, and the 
                    whole world lies in the power of the 
                    evil one.
                    We know that the Son of God has come, 
                    and has given us an understanding, that 
                    we know him who is true, and we are in 
                    him who is true, in his Son Jesus 
                    Christ. This is the true God, and 
                    eternal life.
                    Little children, keep yourselves from 
                    idols.</p>
