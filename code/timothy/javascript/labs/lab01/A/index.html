        <p>Notes: I was getting NaN (Not a Number) returned when I
            attempted to alert(sum). I checked out alert(nums)
            which made it apparent that it <em>was</em> creating my
            nums list, but was adding the string of "done" to the end
            of the list. This was because my .push was outside of the
            loop. Adding my .push to the loop with an <b>else</b>
            fixed the issue.
