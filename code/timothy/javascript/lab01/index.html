    <h1>Python to Javascript</h1>
    <h3>Average Numbers</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Notes: I was getting NaN (Not a Number) returned when I
        attempted to alert(sum).<br> I checked out alert(nums)
        which made it apparent that it <em>was</em> creating my
        nums list,<br> but was adding the string of "done" to the end
        of the list.<br> This was because my .push was outside of the
        loop. Adding my .push to the loop with an <b>else</b>s
        fixed the issue.
