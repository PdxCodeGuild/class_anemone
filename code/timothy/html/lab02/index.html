                    Richard David James (born 18 August 1971), best known as Aphex Twin and less prominently as AFX, 
                    was an Irish-born British musician, composer and DJ. He was best known for his idiosyncratic work 
                    in electronic styles such as techno, ambient, and jungle. Music journalists from publications including Mixmag,
                    The New York Times, NME, Fact, Clash and The Guardian have called James one of the most influential electronic musicians.</p>

                <h3>News of the Cyberworld: Neo-Luddites, Are They Too Late?</h3>
                <p>Neo-Luddism often establishes stark predictions about the effect of new technologies.
                    Although there is not a cohesive vision of the ramifications of technology, neo-Luddism
                    predicts that a future without technological reform has dire consequences. Neo-Luddites
                    believe that current technologies are a threat to humanity and to the natural world in general,
                    and that a future societal collapse is possible or even probable. </p>
                <p>These predictions include changes in humanity's place in the future due to replacement of humans
                    by computers, genetic decay of humans due to lack of natural selection, biological engineering of
                    humans, misuse of technological power including disasters caused by genetically modified organisms,
                    nuclear warfare, and biological weapons; control of humanity using surveillance, propaganda,
                    pharmacological control, and psychological control; humanity failing to adapt to the future
                    manifesting as an increase in psychological disorders, widening economic and political inequality,
                    widespread social alienation, a loss of community, and massive unemployment; technology causing environmental
                    degradation due to shortsightedness, overpopulation, and overcrowding.</p>
