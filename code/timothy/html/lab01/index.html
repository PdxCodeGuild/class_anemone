    <h1><b>Bill Evans</b></h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Bill Evans was an American jazz pianist and composer who mostly worked as the leader of a trio.
        His use of impressionist harmony, interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords,
        and trademark rhythmically independent, "singing" melodic lines continues to influence jazz pianists today.</p>
    <p>Many of Evans's compositions, such as "Waltz for Debby", have become standards, played and recorded by many artists.
        Evans received 31 Grammy nominations and seven awards, and was inducted into the DownBeat Jazz Hall of Fame.</p>

    <q><b>Music should enrich the soul; it should teach spirituality by showing a person a portion of himself that he would
        not discover otherwise. It's easy to rediscover part of yourself, but through art you can be shown part of yourself
        you never knew existed.</b></q>
