    <h1>Bill Evans</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Bill Evans was an American jazz pianist and composer who mostly worked as the leader of a trio.
        His use of impressionist harmony, interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords,
        and trademark rhythmically independent, "singing" melodic lines continues to influence jazz pianists today.</p>
    <p>Many of Evans's compositions, such as "Waltz for Debby", have become standards, played and recorded by many artists.
        Evans received 31 Grammy nominations and seven awards, and was inducted into the DownBeat Jazz Hall of Fame.</p>

    <q>It bugs me when people try to analyze Jazz as an intellectual theorem. It's not, it's <em>feeling.</em></q>
