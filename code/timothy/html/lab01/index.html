    <hr/>
    <p class="whitetext"> Bill Evans was an American jazz pianist and composer who mostly worked as the leader of a trio.
        His use of impressionist harmony, interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords,
        and trademark rhythmically independent, "singing" melodic lines continues to influence jazz pianists today.</p>
