Dev-Notes:

- Originally started with a simple module called playsound. Was so enthralled at getting sound to play from the terminal,
    that I ignored a critical error coming from playsound for ~72 hours.
- Switched to PyAudio for playing the audio files. Much more complicated, but in that sense more "robust" and friendly.
                /PyAudio play() func takes in filepath to .wav file.
                /Basically functions like a 'with open' with a mode that reads the binary structure of the wav file.
- reperlib acts as repr() function but allows for limits on print outputs, just in case there's 5000 kick drum samples.
